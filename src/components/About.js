      <h3>How it all started</h3>
      <p>
        It all started with Myspace. Once Tom was kicked from my top friends'
        list (sorry Tom), I spent all of my 1.55 Mbit/s internet time to
        publicly (?!?) message friends and theme my profile. I really leveled up
        my game when Tumblr came around, so going though the HTML and CSS lesson
        in my computer science class in school was a breeze.
      </p>
      <p>
        With no encouragement or role models for women in engineering, but with
        a great love for languages instead, I chose a career in linguistics and
        teaching first. I pulled a dream job at{' '}
        <a href='https://memrise.com'>Memrise</a> (a language learning app) as a
        content creator for German and got to work on great projects with
        talented people.
      </p>
      <h3>How it's going</h3>
      <p>
        Some of the mentioned very talented people were developers and with
        them, ideas turned into reality. I realised I wanted to do what they do,
        so I took online coding courses. Once I'd confirmed that all those lines
        of code made sense to me, I took a leap and enrolled in General
        Assembly's{' '}

          Software Engineering Immersive course
        </a>
        . And here I am now, a Junior Software Engineer looking to create
        amazing new things!

      <h3>Other things I love (next to coding)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          &#127836; Telling people that chicken pho deserves the same
          appreciation, if not more, as beef pho.
        </li>
        <li>
          &#129342; Being one of the last people on the dodgeball court and
          catching a ball (or hitting an opponent).
