      <h3>How it all started ...</h3>
      <p>
        It all started with Myspace. Once Tom was kicked from my top friends
        list (sorry Tom), I spent all of my 1.55 Mbit/s internet time to
        publicly message friends (?!?) and theme my profile. I'm pretty sure I
        aced the HTML and CSS bit of my computer science class in school because
        of the latter part. Then came Tumblr and oh my. But with no
        encouragement or role models for women in engineering, but with a great
        love for languages instead, I chose a career in linguistics and teaching
        first. I pulled a dream job at Memrise (a language learning app) as a
        content creator for German and got to work on great projects with
        wonderful people.

      <h3>How it's going</h3>
      <p>
        Some of the mentioned wonderful people were developers and with them,
        ideas turned into reality. I realised I wanted to do what they do, so I
        took online online coding courses. Once I've confirmed that all those
        lines of code made sense to me, I took a leap and enrolled in General
        Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive course. And here I am now, a
        Junior Software Engineer looking to create amazing things!

      <h3>Other things I love (next to coding)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          &#127836; Explaining to people why chicken pho is great, only
          Vietnamese restaurants in the west are catering to the local taste too
          much.
        </li>
        <li>
          &#129342; Being one of the last people on the dodgeball court and
          catching a ball (or hitting an opponent).
        </li>
        <li> &#127969; Property and Interior Design tv shows.</li>
