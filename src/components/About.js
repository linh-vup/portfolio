      <h3>How it all started</h3>
      <p>
        It all started with Myspace. Once Tom was kicked from my top friends'
        list (sorry Tom), I spent all of my 1.55 Mbit/s internet time to
        publicly (?!?) message friends and theme my profile. I really leveled up
        my game when Tumblr came around, so going though the HTML and CSS lesson
        in my computer science class in school was a breeze.
      </p>
      <p>
        But with no encouragement or role models for women in engineering, but
        with a great love for languages instead, I chose a career in linguistics
        and teaching first. I pulled a dream job at Memrise (a language learning
        app) as a content creator for German and got to work on great projects
        with talented people.
      </p>
      <h3>How it's going</h3>
      <p>
        Some of the mentioned very talented people were developers and with
        them, ideas turned into reality. I realised I wanted to do what they do,
        so I took online coding courses. Once I've confirmed that all those
        lines of code made sense to me, I took a leap and enrolled in General
        Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive course. And here I am now, a
        Junior Software Engineer looking to create amazing new things!

      <h3>Other things I love (next to coding)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          &#127836; Explaining to people why chicken pho is great, only
          Vietnamese restaurants in the west are catering to the local taste too
          much.
        </li>
        <li>
          &#129342; Being one of the last people on the dodgeball court and
          catching a ball (or hitting an opponent).
        </li>
        <li> &#127969; Property and Interior Design tv shows.</li>
